# Exploring the Effects of Time Dilation on Formula 1 Drivers

This repository contains supplemental data and code for the "Physics in the World" presentation, part of Physics 122 at Guilford College. The project explores the concept of time dilation in the context of Formula 1 racing, using real-world F1 data to analyze and visualize relativistic effects and race dynamics.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:**
  - To demonstrate and analyze time dilation and related physics concepts using Formula 1 race data.
  - To provide visualizations and data-driven insights for educational purposes.

- **Presentation:**
  - See `docs/presentation.pdf` for the slides used in the Physics 122 presentation.

## Repository Structure

- `data/` — Contains all raw and processed F1 datasets (circuits, drivers, lap times, races, etc.).
  - `recent/` — Subfolder with recent or filtered datasets for focused analysis.
- `plots/` — Output images and visualizations generated by the analysis code.
- `data_filtering.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook for cleaning and filtering the datasets.
- `experiment.ipynb` — Main analysis and visualization notebook, demonstrating time dilation and other physics concepts.

## Data Sources

The data in the `data/` folder is based on publicly available Formula 1 datasets, including information on circuits, drivers, lap times, races, and more. These datasets are used to perform calculations and generate visualizations relevant to the physics of time dilation.

## Results & Visualizations

- Key plots and figures are saved in the `plots/` directory, such as:
  - `driver_deltas.png`: Driver time differences
  - `velocity_vs_scale.png`: Velocity vs. relativistic scale
